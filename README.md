Always Curious For New Tech...<br>
<p style=justify>I am a Full-Stack developer based in Midnapore, India. I am currently pursuing MCA from the University of North Bengal. I have a serious passion for UI effects, animations, and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.I am a well-organized person, a problem solver with high attention to detail. I am interested in the entire front-end spectrum and enjoy working on ambitious projects with positive people.
